# Emacs-Dotfiles

Dotfiles are how you customize your system. These are mine. (And now they can be yours.) 

Preferences include:
* Helm completion framework
* Hybrid keybindings
* Magit
* Org mode
* Dark theme (with quick toggle)

...and a few other tiny little features that I personally enjoy.

## Installation

Follow the install instructions at [spacemacs.org](spacemacs.org) and replace your .spacemacs file with this one.
